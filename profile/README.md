## Hi there 👋

[中文版本](https://github.com/XRealityZone/.github/blob/main/profile/README-CN.md)

Welcome, brave explorers of the XR world, to the land called XRealityZone.

XRealityZone is a community of creators focused on the XR field. We hope to help any aspiring creators who want to create and deepen their work in the XR world through in-depth articles and tutorials, simple but useful tools, and active but not noisy discussion groups.

We strongly believe that one person may go fast, but only a group of people can go far.

Currently, we're focusing on the following:

- **[XR World Weekly](https://xreality.zone/en/tags/newsletter/)**: This is a periodical that only brings you high-quality XR information, a half-monthly issue on average, hoping to bring you a "refreshing" reading experience every time you read it.
- **[XR development articles](https://xreality.zone/en/tags/article/)**: in the era of lack of XR development information, we hope to present the knowledge we already have, to bring a ray of hopeful green to the barren desert.
If you like what we are doing, you are welcome to bookmark and forward the articles on the site.

If you are interested in what we are doing, you are very welcome to leave a comment under any article or contact us via [Email](mailto:xreality.zone@outlook.com).
